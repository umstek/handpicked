Software and other stuff that I use. Storing here in case if I lose my memory. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
I'm not affiliated with any of the software below unless mentioned otherwise.

## Video players

1. VLC Media Player: I liked the 2.x but when 3.x arrived, some things were broken. Now all of them are fixed I guess and you are good to go. VLC (for Android) was the only player that could render HDR content (software rendered with messed up colors, but still) on my old non-HDR phone.
2. Daum PotPlayer: This is my current choice on Windows. Plays all formats just like VLC. Better UI and controls.
3. KM Player: A popular media player.
4. MX Player: I use this on Android as my default player.

## Video converters etc.

1. XMedia Recode

## Virtualization software

1. VirtualBox VM: free virtual machine software.

## Sharing mouse and keyboard among computers

1. Mouse without Boarders: A Microsoft Garage Project. Shares mouse/keyboard/clipboard/drag-drop among upto 4 PCs. Sometimes, there's a lag and this is natural. 

## Code Editors

1. Visual Studio Code: Obviously. I'm not that geeky to use vim or emacs.
2. Notepad++: Use it when the need is simple and vscode is overkill. I use it to edit configuration files etc. but it is powerful and can replace your favorite editor if you use it with its plugin ecosystem.

## Hex editors

1. HxD: Free and enough.
2. https://hexed.it/: All apps are going online. This is a good example.

## JSON Editors

1. https://jsoneditoronline.org/: or just use vscode.

## Database Clients

1. HeidiSQL: A free client for postgres, mysql etc.
2. MongoDBCompass: Official client for MongoDB

## Password managers

1. Bitwarden: password manager for all platforms and browsers; has a vault for notes, and a built-in password generator.

## 2FA managers

1. Authy: Because Google Authenticator doesn't have sync, I lost access to one of my valuable accounts. I switched to Authy from that day.

## Antivirus software

1. Windows Defender: It sometimes [doesn't detect](https://twitter.com/hexmint/status/1370578440898846723) malware that it should, and at other times it bothers me when I knowingly open 'dangerous things'. Except that, it's enough.

## Screen recorders

1. Press Win+G to open Windows game bar, if you are a normal person.
2. ShareX: A free, feature rich screen capture tool.
3. https://screenapp.io/: An online screen recorder with more features if you pay. I was a developer here so üòÅ

## Office

1. Microsoft Office: of course. (If you can afford it.) The Android version is good too, and with sync.
2. WPS Office: Freeware. Lighter. Fails to render some unicode fonts such as Sinhala fonts. Android version is good too.
3. Polaris Office: Okay I have 3 office programs in my phone and each of them has some feature that others don't.

## Note-taking software/journaling

1. Notion: this is the best I've come across. Good for drafting ideas, planning trips, keeping shopping lists, [comparing products](https://twitter.com/hexmint/status/1355204683791429634), whatnot.

## Compression/archiving

1. [7-Zip-zstd](https://mcmilk.de/projects/7-Zip-zstd/) (7zip with additional algorithms): because I can't imagine why people are still using WinRAR. Use LZMA2 with compression level set to Ultra for best results (this is slow). 7zip file manager opens most if not all archive formats.
2. Windows context menu "Send to compressed (zipped) folder": if you want it to support more platforms.
3. ZArchiver: for Android.

## Download managers

1. Free Download Manager: has most of what you need + torrents.
2. ADM: for Android.

## E-book readers (software)

1. eReader Prestigio: for Android. Supports many formats, has TTS, dark mode, font support etc.
2. Comic Screen: a comic book reader for Android with CBZ support.
3. Adobe Acrobat: for the default PDF experience.

## Cloud storage and backup

1. https://mega.nz/

## E-mail providers

1. https://protonmail.com/: encrypted email.

## Dictionary

1. WordWeb: This can show similar words, subtypes, supertypes etc. If you are using the Android version, you can cheat hangman with the wildcard search support.
