# Software and services

## Video players

1. VLC Media Player: VLC (for Android) was the only player that could render HDR content (software rendered with messed up colors, but still) on my old non-HDR phone.
2. Daum PotPlayer: This is my current choice on Windows. Plays all formats just like VLC. Better UI and controls.
3. KM Player: A popular media player.
4. MX Player: I use this on Android as my default player.

## Video converters etc

1. XMedia Recode
2. ffmpeg if you're good with command line

## Virtualization software

1. VirtualBox VM: free virtual machine software.

## Sharing mouse and keyboard among computers

1. [Mouse without Boarders](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/mouse-without-borders): A Microsoft Garage Project. Shares mouse/keyboard/clipboard/drag-drop among upto 4 PCs. Sometimes, there's a lag and this is natural. This is now integrated into powertoys.
2. If you have a logitech mouse, you can use Logi Options+ Flow.

## Code Editors

1. Visual Studio Code: Obviously. I'm not that geeky to use vim or emacs.
2. Notepad++: Use it when the need is simple and vscode is overkill. I use it to edit configuration files etc. but it is powerful and can replace your favorite editor if you use it with its plugin ecosystem.
3. Neovim: I'm unfamiliar with (neo)vim, but you might be able to get this configured with [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), [Nvim Basic IDE](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide), or [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) that it will be closer to an IDE. 

## Hex editors

1. [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex): A hex editor with a massive plugin system.
2. HxD: Free and enough.

## JSON Editors

1. [JSON editor online](https://jsoneditoronline.org)
2. or just use vscode.

## Database Clients

1. [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
2. [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/): A free client for postgres, mysql etc.
3. MongoDBCompass: Official client for MongoDB

## Password managers

1. Bitwarden: password manager for all platforms and browsers; has a vault for notes, and a built-in password generator.

## 2FA managers

1. Authy: Because Google Authenticator's lack of sync, I lost access to one of my valuable accounts. I switched to Authy from that day. (Anyway the account was bitbucket and I recovered it recently.)

## Antivirus software

1. Windows Defender: It sometimes [doesn't detect](https://twitter.com/hexmint/status/1370578440898846723) malware that it should, and at other times it bothers me when I knowingly open 'dangerous things'. Except that, it's enough.

## Screen recorders/screenshot tools

1. Press Win+G to open Windows game bar, if you are a normal person.
2. [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/): This is just a screenshot tool with most commonly needed features.
3. ShareX: A free, feature rich screen capture tool. Captures Screenshots, GIFs etc.
4. [ScreenApp](https://screenapp.io): An online screen recorder, library, transcription, etc. (some are paid features). I was a developer here so üòÅ
5. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/): A broadcaster software. Overkill for just a screen recording. A suggestion by a friend. 

## Office

1. Microsoft Office: of course. (If you can afford it.) The Android version is good too, and with sync.
2. WPS Office: Freeware. Lighter. Fails to render some unicode fonts. Android version is good too.
3. Polaris Office: Okay I have 3 office programs in my phone and each of them has some feature that others don't.

## Note-taking software/journaling

1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): This wasn't that good for some time but now it has a massive, open plugin system. Maybe as not as pretty as Notion, but it uses markdown mainly. This is my default note taker.
3. Notion: this ~is~ was the best I've come across. Good for drafting ideas, planning trips, keeping shopping lists, [comparing products](https://twitter.com/hexmint/status/1355204683791429634), whatnot. Now it has its own Chat-GPT like AI assistant. 

## Compression/archiving

1. [7-Zip-zstd](https://mcmilk.de/projects/7-Zip-zstd/) (7zip with additional algorithms): because I can't imagine why people are still using WinRAR. Use LZMA2 with compression level set to Ultra for best results (this is slow). 7zip file manager opens most if not all archive formats. _Bonus plugins:_ <https://www.tc4shell.com/en/7zip/>
3. Windows context menu "Send to compressed (zipped) folder": if you want it to support more platforms.
4. ZArchiver: for Android.

## Download managers

1. Free Download Manager: has most of what you need + torrents, for Windows and Android.

## E-book readers (software)

1. eReader Prestigio: for Android. Supports many formats, has TTS, dark mode, font support etc.
2. Comic Screen: a comic book reader for Android with CBZ support.
3. Adobe Acrobat: for the default PDF experience.

## Cloud storage and backup

1. <https://mega.nz/>

## E-mail providers

1. [ProtonMail](https://proton.me): encrypted email.

## Dictionary

1. WordWeb: This can show similar words, subtypes, supertypes etc. If you are using the Android version, you can cheat hangman with the wildcard search support.

## Reverse dictionary

1. [WantWords](https://wantwords.net): an opensource reverse dictionary based on [Multi-channel Reverse Dictionary Model](https://github.com/thunlp/WantWords) but probably now you can just use ChatGPT.
